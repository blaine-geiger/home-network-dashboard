# Home Network Dashboard
This is a simple web browser based dashboard to access local IP:port combinations for network resources. This simplifies the process and does
not require the user to type the resource URL address into an address bar to gain access to frequently used interfaces. There are many ways to link to these
resources (even simple browser bookmarks) but I felt it would give me a chance to refresh myself with an HTML and CSS. JavaScript wasn't needed to acheive functionality.

The side pop-out menus were an afterthought and lead to specific pages within the services for more precise navigation. The pop-menus work by hovering with the mouse cursor. 
They are to show function of coding and customization more than to serve an essential purpose.

The image is owned by me and hosted locally.

## Screenshots
The images below show the different menu options and each lead to specific interfaces. These include the GUIs for my network devices like firewall, router, and switch. There are also quick links for locally hosted services like Docker, Prometheus, InfluxDB, and Grafana.
